# Axos-discord-NewUI-Cleaner
just a revamp of some pieces of discord UI

The idea of this CSS is to make the new UI look more like the old one and to make the user experience better.

### known bugs and problems

 - The icons on the server, such as the mention, stream and VC icons, are in the wrong position.
 - the inbox and help buttons are innacessible(i had to hide them to avoid some ugly visual overlap since i do not know how to change the positions lol)

## Example images
Top bar with the server name removed

User profile and settings panel modified to not overlap with the servers panel

After you start to type some text in the messages search bar it expands:
